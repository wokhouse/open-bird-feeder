# Plan — open-birdhouse

XIAO ESP32S3 Sense (onboard camera, 8MB PSRAM) takes bird photos and POSTs
them to an ingest service on the LAN (dev: this laptop, prod: a Pi).
Hardwired to power; on-device bird/no-bird model gates capture.

## Architecture

Device: OV2640/OV3660 low-res probe frames -> int8 bird/no-bird classifier
(tflite-micro + esp-nn, ~1-2 fps) -> on bird-present edge (debounced):
capture XGA JPEG -> HTTP POST photo + probe frame + score. Timer-triggered
mode stays as fallback / bootstrap data collection.

Receiver (FastAPI): stores uploads under data/<kind>/<date>/HHMMSS_<device>.jpg,
gallery page at /, later: labeling UI + training exports.

## Hardware facts (verified this session)

- Board: ESP32-S3 QFN56 rev v0.2, 8MB flash + 8MB octal PSRAM, MAC 7c:4f:ad:* (Seeed OUI) = XIAO ESP32S3 Sense.
- Camera pins (fixed by Sense board): XCLK=10, SCCB SDA=40 SCL=39,
  Y9..Y2 = 48,11,12,14,16,18,17,15, VSYNC=38, HREF=47, PCLK=13. Sensor model auto-detected.
- Console = native USB-Serial/JTAG (/dev/cu.usbmodem*). Reading the port must NOT
  assert DTR (pyserial open() stalls the app in download mode); scripts/grab_photo.py
  uses raw fds instead.
- No onboard WiFi antenna: U.FL rod antenna must be attached before Phase 3.
- IDF v5.2.1 at ~/esp/esp-idf-v5.2.1; export with IDF_PYTHON_ENV_PATH=~/.espressif/python_env/idf5.2_py3.14_env (system python upgrade pitfall).

## Phases

1. **Camera bring-up** — DONE 2026-10-31: XGA 1024x768 JPEG (28KB q12) captured on-device,
   base64 over the USB-CDC console, decoded by scripts/grab_photo.py, verified as a real
   scene (data/first_photo.jpg). Sensor model not printed in captured window; irrelevant.
   Firmware emits a photo every 8 s between --PHOTO-BEGIN--/--PHOTO-END-- markers.
   Note: sensor is mounted on the loose Sense board (image was sideways) — mount it before Phase 3 field tests.
2. **Ingest service** — DONE 2026-10-31: FastAPI /upload (photo+probe kinds) verified via
   curl (exact byte round-trip), gallery + static serving return 200. Runs on :8077 via
   ingest/run.sh. Pitfall fixed: StaticFiles mount needs DATA dir to exist at import.
3. **Capture+upload loop** — DONE 2026-10-31: firmware joins sleepycatwifi (U.FL fitted,
   +heatsink), POSTs XGA JPEG every 8 s to http://<laptop en0>:8077/upload?kind=photo with
   X-Device-Id xiao-<mac tail>; serial byte counts match stored file sizes exactly.
   Secrets in main/secrets.h (gitignored; .example provided). Laptop is wired on en0 —
   same LAN as the WiFi, reachable. Port note: re-enumerates on replug (currently usbmodem11301).
4. **Training loop offline** — tooling DONE 2026-10-31: /label clicker (b/n keys, auto-advance
   to next unlabeled, progress counter), labels in ingest/labels.db (tracked in git),
   /export.csv (path,label), gallery shows label colors. Verified via curl + real browser.
   Remaining: fine-tune MobileNetV3-Small + quantize once real-scene frames accumulate.
5. **On-device gating** — flash model, probe loop @1-2 fps, debounce + burst capture on bird edges.
6. **Pi deployment** — same ingest service on the Pi, point device at it. Hardening: retries, buffers.

Decision at end of Phase 3 (alt): stream probes to Pi for a real detector instead
of on-device model — pipeline is the same either way.

## Layout

- firmware/   ESP-IDF project (esp32-camera managed component)
- ingest/     FastAPI ingest + gallery
- scripts/    host tooling (grab_photo.py, ...)
